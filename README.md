DESCRIPTION

This is my e-commerce page! I was inspired from the video made by GreatStacks and got some of my assets and elements are from him! Welcome to my website! The virtual emporium where your wallet goes to get lighter! We've got more stuff than your grandma's attic and more deals than a flea market on a hot summer day. From insane fashion statements to heavy duty prosthesis, we specialize in the strange, the useless, and the downright unnecessary. Need a robot assistant who eerily looks into your soul? We've got you covered. How about a usb flash drive that can store not just files, but things as well? Yep, we've got that too. So, why wait? Dive into our digital treasure trove and emerge with more random stuff than you ever knew you needed!
The site runs on react and express. For my database, I used MongoDB and utilize CORS so I can have my frontend and backend talk. I also madeuse of middleware called Multer. Multer helps organize my images easier when files are being uploaded to my Mongo database. Speaking of images, I also integrated images from various people from unsplash whose profiles I will include in the bottom. And lastly, I was inspired to do this sort of website from the video made by GreatStacks; some of my assets and elements are from him!



TECHSTACK

    React: JavaScript library for building UI
    CSS: Used for styling my pages

Backend:
    Node: JS runtime environment that runs JS on the server-side.
    Express: Framework for Node and lets me build apps and setup the api.
    MongoDB: This is the database I decided to use. Alongside it, I used mongoose so I can interact with my database.
    It allows me to use built in methods (find and findOne was used a bit) to make life a little easier.
    Cors: Middleware for Express.js that lets my front and back end to talk.

Deployment:
