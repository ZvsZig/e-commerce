Hello! This is my e-commerce page! I was inspired from the video made by GreatStacks and got some of my assets and elements are from him! The site runs on react and express. For my database, I used MongoDB and utilize CORS for some base level security. I also made use of middleware called Multer. Multer helps organize my images easier when files are being uploaded to my Mongo database. Speaking of images, I also integrated images from various people from unsplash whose profiles I will include in the bottom.
