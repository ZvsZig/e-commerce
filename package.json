For my database, I used MongoDB and utilize CORS for some base level security. I also made\r use of middleware called Multer. Multer helps organize my images easier when files are being uploaded to my Mongo database. \r Speaking of images, I also integrated images from various people from unsplash whose profiles I will include in the bottom.",
